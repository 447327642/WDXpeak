## Machine Learning Definition

Arthur Samuel(1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell(1998): Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
