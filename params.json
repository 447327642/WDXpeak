I want an elegant way to note my life.\r\n\r\nEvernote is a great tool to collect and connect to the word. But not a good tool to build links within. So It's time to change!\r\n\r\n不要导入，整理并思考，完整的复制没有意义，有目的收集才是正道\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is how I arrange my personal notebook\r\n\r\n+ Body: building strong body\r\n+ Computer Science: well I have to learn something to make my life\r\n+ Daily: what a mess\r\n+ English: how can I survive in USA\r\n+ Imagine: jumping into the future\r\n+ Interest: love something, do that thing\r\n+ Kindle: clippings from kindle\r\n+ Life: different aspects of my life\r\n+ List: books, packages, fit, etc, all about list\r\n+ Mind: limitation never exists\r\n+ Novel: time for fun\r\n+ Project: working on them\r\n+ Science: my religion\r\n+ Work: do something, love that thing\r\n+ World: just want to know more\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
