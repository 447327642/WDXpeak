I want an elegant way to note my life.\r\n\r\nEvernote is a great tool to collect and connect to the word. But not a good tool to build links within. So It's time to change!\r\n\r\n不要导入，整理并思考，完整的复制没有意义，有目的收集才是正道\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is how I arrange my personal notebook\r\n\r\n+ **computer**  : basic & important knowledge about computer science\r\n+ **algorithm** : Prepare for interview\r\n+ **tool**   : programming tools for effeciency\r\n+ facial expression research : research notes for 2015 spring\r\n+ cuda       : cuda programming note\r\n+ openmp     : Techniques for parallel computation\r\n+ english    : notes for learning English\r\n+ foundation of computer architecture : CMU 18640 course notes\r\n+ fastcode   : CMU 18645 course notes\r\n+ game       : game related notes\r\n+ design     : programming language as well as product related topics\r\n+ management : manage project and code\r\n+ mobile     : mobile development notes\r\n+ cpp        : several notes from coding c plus plus\r\n+ python     : Need re-document\r\n+ html5      : Need re-document\r\n+ java       : Need re-document\r\n+ objc       : Need re-document\r\n+ py-opencv  : Use opencv with python\r\n+ loading    : some notes that do not have a specific category\r\n+ collection : Some old .page documents for computer science\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
